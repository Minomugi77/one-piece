        <P><span>Gear Fifth</span><br>The awakening of the Gomu Gomu no Mi, also known as the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, grants the user's rubber-like body increased strength and freedom, limited only by the user's imagination. It is for this reason that the user is said to become the "embodiment of freedom", able to bring joy to the people around them and making it "the most ridiculous power in the world".One of the most notable features of the awakened form is granting cartoon-like effects, not only to the user, but also to their opponent, an example being eye-popping effects, and cartoonish welts after a head injury; also, while in this state, the user displays a grand state of elation and confidence.</P>
